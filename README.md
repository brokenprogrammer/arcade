This is an over the weekend project to develop a tetris game from scratch.
No libraries were used and I took the time to also try out WebGL for the first time.

There are of course things that could have been done better but this was more of a self-challenge. I might go back to this project and fix the coding conventions and perhaps make the game look better in the future. For now its going to stay as a one weekend art-piece.

## Try the game
The game is available at [oskarmendel.me/arcade](https://oskarmendel.me/arcade/).

## Controls
| Button        | Action        |
| ------------- |:-------------:
| Up Arrow      | Rotate piece |
| Left Arrow    | Move piece left      |
| Right Arrow   | Move piece right      |
| Down Arrow   | Make piece fall faster      |
| Spacebar   | Place piece      |
